# Release Note Maker
Use the Github API to generate Release Notes from a list of commit messages

## Introduction

### Development mode

In the development mode, we will have 2 servers running. The front end code will be served by the [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) which helps with hot and live reloading. The server side Express code will be served by a node server using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which helps in automatically restarting the server whenever server side code changes.

### Production mode

In the production mode, we will have only 1 server running. All the client side code will be bundled into static files using webpack and it will be served by the Node.js/Express application.

## Quick Start

```bash

# Start production server
yarn start (or npm start)
```

### Folder Structure

All the source code will be inside **src** directory. Inside src, there is client and server directory. All the frontend code (react, css, js and any other assets) will be in client directory. Backend Node.js/Express code will be in the server directory.
